The threat actors are believed to have been on a mission to navigate the US power grid and its controls. While the intruders did not attempt to damage the power grid or other critical infrastructure, officials warned that they could try to do so in the event of a crisis or war.
The intruders were not detected by the companies responsible for the infrastructure, but by US intelligence agencies, officials said.
Officials said other infrastructure systems, such as water or sewage systems, were also at risk.

994,Cuba Ransomware Gang disrupted Montenegro government servers in DDOS and Ransomware attack - 2022,"An initial attack against the Montenegro government occurred on August 20, 2022, and by August 22, 2022, the government reported that ""two series of cyber-attacks on government servers"" were occurring. According to the malware researchers at VX-Underground, the Cuba Ransomware Gang claimed responsibility, via their leak site During the cyber attack, 150 workstations in 10 state institutions in Montenegro were disrupted, including the Ministry of Finance, using the virus Zerodate. The hackers also claimed to have stolen internal information and the media reported that exfiltrated information was leaked. Disclosed data comprised financial documents, correspondence with banks, balance sheets, tax documents, compensation, and source code tied to the Montenegrin parliament, according to the hacker group and Montenegrin state officials. Additionally, the media reported that the hackers demanded $10 million as a ransom payment; however, officials have now stated that a demand for ransom payment was never received. The cyber attack included targeting electricity systems, ""water supply systems, transportation services and online government services;"" and infected data at the Ministry of Public Administration and ""some retail tax collection."" The National Security Agency (ANB) stated that the attack was ""unprecedented."" EPCG, a state-owned power utility, switched to manual operation as a preventative measure after the ANB warned that they could be a target during the attack. Public Administration Minister Maras Dukaj stated that the attack was still ongoing on September 1, 2022, and many government websites were still unavailable to users. Having the digital infrastructure of the government and judicial system remain offline also led to delays in court processes since users could not access the Judicial Information System, PRIS. Experts identified that tactics of the cyber attack involved both DDOS and ransomware.

Shortly after the attack, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Rasko Konjevic noted his belief that the government had gathered sufficient evidence to link the interference to Russia, supported by an informal press briefing by Montenegro's National Security Agency that pointed to ""several Russian services"" as the sponsors of the attack. In a meeting on October 4, the National Security Council concluded to wait for further details from foreign partners to make any determination of the responsible party with confidence. Anonymous high-ranking officials of the Montenegrin National Security Agency (ANB) continue to suspect that Russian security services are responsible for the cyber-attack that held critical infrastructure, specifically electricity and water supply, at risk and forced a switch to manual control of power plants. In a rare instance, the US embassy in Montenegro issued a security alert on August 26, 2022, advising to limit movement to necessary travel in response to uncertain disruptions to public utilities, transportation, and telecommunication caused by a ""persistent and ongoing cyber-attack"". Reporting on August 31st, 2022, stated that the US would send FBI cyber experts, called Cyber Action Teams (CAT), to Montenegro in a support capacity. France sent a team from the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems. The states sent support in response due to Montenegro's NATO membership and the commitment to collective defense of the NATO alliance.

Experts are not readily willing to link the Cuba ransomware gang to the Russian government. However, researchers who have analyzed the ransom negotiations with the cyber threat actors claim that the hackers linked to the leak site for the group speak Russian.

1468,Russian APT Gamaredon targeted Ukrainian organizations with infostealer in cyber operations,"The Russian state-sponsored APT Gamaredon aka Shuckworm targeted unnamed Ukrainian organizations from July 15 until at least August 8, 2022. It used an infostealer in order to spy on its targets, according to attributing IT-company Symantec. 
The Russian state-sponsored APT Gamaredon aka Shuckworm targeted Ukrainian government organizations once again since August 2022 with a new infostealer, according to the technical report of Cisco Talos.
The Russian state-sponsored APT Gamaredon attacks continued in September 2022 with various targets in Ukraine, including targeting Ukrainian government agencies which included defense and law enforcement agencies. The intention of the attacks by the bad actors appeared to be partly with the goal of data theft, and partly with the goal of increasing its offensive capabilities. IT specialists from Cisco Talos have analyzed the activity of the APT group and have observed that the hackers use phishing documents with malware, called Infostealer, which is embedded in computers to gain further access to the networks. The malware provides the hackers the ability to exfiltrate files and ""deploy binary and script-based payloads to infected end devices."" The APT threat actors are known to specifically and exclusively target Ukrainian targets.

1501,Hackers linked to Iran's MOIS disrupted Albania's Total Information Managment System (TIMS) on 9 September 2022 and leaked internal information related to State Police,"HomeLand Justice, a front the US government suspects to be coordinated by Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), infiltrated the data storage and transmission systems of Albania's State Police on 9 September, according to a statement by Albania's Ministry of the Interior. The intrusion led to the temporary shutdown of the Total Information Management System (TIMS), which gathers information on the entries and exits of people and vehicles. Data obtained in the compromise was subsequently offered for sale. This operation follows the public attribution by Albania and NATO allies of an earlier cyber-operation, which had culminated in the disruption of Albanian government services on 15 July 2022, to Iranian state-sponsored hackers. On 19 September, HomeLand Justice disclosed email exchanges of former General Police Director Gledis Nano, including with foreign officials.
The group on subsequent occasions published what appeared to be internal information from systems operated by the Albanian State Police. A cache divulged on 3 October, contained the personal details of individuals suspected of crimes by the Albanian authorities, including photos, names, date of birth, and ID numbers. The origins of the leak remain unclear. The State Police has refuted reports about MEMEX, its system to collect information on investigations, being the source and maintained that the database had not been compromised. A local Albanian media outlet, referring to unnamed officials involved in the investigation, reported that an Albanian citizen enabled access to the data. On 10 October, the group released details of 300 police officers, including their names, photos, and other personal information. The provenance of this information has not been publicly ascertained.",2022-09-09,2022-10-10,"Attack conducted by nation state (generic “state-attribution” or direct attribution towards specific state-entities, e.g., intelligence agencies); Attack on (inter alia) political target(s), politicized",,Incident disclosed by attacker; Incident disclosed by authorities of victim state,Data theft & Doxing,"[['Albanian State Police'], ['Gledis Nano']]","['Albania', 'Albania']","[['EUROPE', 'BALKANS', 'NATO', 'WBALKANS'], ['EUROPE', 'BALKANS', 'NATO', 'WBALKANS']]","[['State institutions / political system'], ['State institutions / political system']]","[['Police'], ['Police']]",['Not available'],"['Iran, Islamic Republic of']",['State'],,3,2022-09-10; 2022-09-11; 2022-09-21,"Political statement / report (e.g., on government / state agency websites); Political statement / report (e.g., on government / state agency websites); Technical report (e.g., by IT-companies, Citizen Lab, EFF)",Attribution by receiver government / state entity; Attribution by third-party; Attribution by third-party,"Edi Rama (Prime Minister, ALB); National Security Council; Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)",,Albania; United States; United States,Not available; Not available; HomeLand Justice/ Homeland Justice,"Iran, Islamic Republic of; Iran, Islamic Republic of; Iran, Islamic Republic of",State; State; State,,"['https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1568782751511486469?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1568782751511486469%7Ctwgr%5E66097bdaeec8ebc8a08689dfbb86d745b609563c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dw.com%2Fen%2Falbania-once-again-the-target-of-cyberattacks-after-cutting-diplomatic-ties-with-iran-and-expelling-diplomats%2Fa-63146285', 'https://twitter.com/ediramaal/status/1568523932029919232', 'https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-264a']",System / ideology,System/ideology; National power; Third-party intervention / third-party affection,Iran (opposition); Iran (opposition); Iran (Opposition),Not available,,0,,,,,,No,,Not available,Data Exfiltration,Not available,False,For private / commercial targets: sensitive information (incident scores 2 points in intensity),Not available,Not available,none,none,2,Moderate - high political importance,2.0,Low,8.0,Day (< 24h),"Data corruption (deletion/altering) but no leaking of data, no data breach/exfiltration OR major data breach / exfiltration, but no data corruption and/or leaking of data",1-10,0.0,1-10,0.0,Not available,0.0,euro,Direct (official members of state entities / agencies / units responsible),Sovereignty,,Not available,0,,,,,,Not available,,Countermeasures under international law justified (state-atttribution & breach of international law),,"['https://www.databreaches.net/gag-order-issued-to-stop-release-of-information-stolen-by-hackers/', 'https://www.dw.com/en/albania-once-again-the-target-of-cyberattacks-after-cutting-diplomatic-ties-with-iran-and-expelling-diplomats/a-63146285', 'https://twitter.com/WHNSC/status/1568782751511486469?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1568782751511486469%7Ctwgr%5E66097bdaeec8ebc8a08689dfbb86d745b609563c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dw.com%2Fen%2Falbania-once-again-the-target-of-cyberattacks-after-cutting-diplomatic-ties-with-iran-and-expelling-diplomats%2Fa-63146285', 'https://twitter.com/ediramaal/status/1568523932029919232', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/10/politics/albania-cyberattack-iran/index.html', 'https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa22-264a', 'https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/albanian-national-security-council-convenes-over-iran-cyber-attacks/', 'https://lajme.rtsh.al/artikull/sulmet-kibernetike-mbledhja-e-keshillit-te-sigurimit-kombetar-institucionet-raportojne-mbi-masat-e-marra-', 'https://dosja.al/politike/mbledhja-me-begajn-per-et-kibernetike-ibrahimaj-zbardh-biseden-me-d-i248361', 'https://dosja.al/politike/presidenti-mbledh-keshillin-e-sigurise-kombetare-rel-opozita-e-kishte-k-i248443', 'https://mb-gov-al.translate.goog/reagim-i-ministrise-se-brendshme-rikthehet-sistemi-tims-pas-sulmit-kibernetik/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=wapp', 'https://www.balkanweb.com/sulmi-kibernetik-me-hakerat-iraniane-bashkepunoi-edhe-nje-shqiptar/', 'https://balkaninsight.com/2022/10/03/iranian-hackers-leak-database-of-albanian-criminal-suspects/', 'http://en.ata.gov.al/2022/10/03/state-police-memex-system-data-are-not-hacked/', 'https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/hackers-continue-to-leak-data-from-albanian-intelligence-services/']"
1502,Iranian state-sponsored hackers disrupted Albanian government websites and essential services on 15 July 2022,"Iranian state-sponsored hackers shut down the websites of the Albanian Parliament and the Prime Minister’s office as well as access to the e-government platform e-Albania, according to a video statement by Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama. Attackers encrypted and destroyed data enabling essential services and leaked government information, including elements from emails by the prime minister and the ministry of foreign affairs. 
Microsoft attributed the activity with high confidence to at least four Iranian politically motivated hacking groups. Technical reports by the FBI and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued supporting findings, followed by statements of the US National Security Council and the UK Foreign Office condemning the attacks and identifying links to state sponsors in Iran. Reactions of the Foreign Office were founded on conclusions by the UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) that Iranian state-sponsored ""almost certainly"" bore responsibility for the attacks. In a statement by the National Atlantic Council, NATO recognized this attribution of responsibility to Iran by allies. 
The cyber attack took place ahead of a People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK) summit originally planned for 23-24 July 2022 in Albania, which has been hosting core members of the group. The MEK forms part of the National Council of Resistance of Iran and is considered a terrorist group by Iran. 
The technical report of the FBI and CISA concluded that one of the Iranian threat actors gained access to the network of the Albanian government 14 months before initiating the disruptive effects on 15 July.",2021-05-01,2022-07-21,"Attack conducted by non-state group / non-state actor with political goals (religious, ethnic, etc. groups) / undefined actor with political goals;

1511,CaddyWiper: Russian state-sponsored hacker group attacked a ukrainian bank and other targets on the 14th of March 2022,"CaddyWiper: Russian state-sponsored hacker group Sandworm (GRU Unit 74455) (aka Telebots, Voodoo Bear, and Iron Viking) is attributed to an attack on a Ukrainian bank and other Ukrainian targets, including targets within the energy industry, beginning on March 14 2022.  The IT-security company, ESET, made the assessment with high confidence. The ESET researchers worked closely with CERT-UA when ICS-capable malware, including an infamous Industroyer malware (previously used in a 2016 Sandworm APT attack that cut Ukrainian power), and regular disk wipers for Windows, Linux and Solaris operating systems was used in an attack against Ukrainian energy providers. Following the most recent malware attack, CERT-UA renamed the malware Industroyer2. CaddyWiper was found on March 14, 2022, to have been used in an attack against a Ukrainian Bank and again on April 8, 2022, against a Ukrainian energy provider in which a temporary disruption occurred and power was cut from nine substations (according to a non-public document from CERT-UA). In addition to Industroyer2 and CaddyWiper, Sandworm deployed various destructive malware families including ORCSHRED, SOLOSHRED, and AWFULSHRED. The initial compromise of the IT system is not known nor how the attackers transitioned from the IT network to the Industrial Control System (ICS) network. Cooperations with Microsoft and ESET allow the Ukrainian cybersecurity professionals to continue to investigate and respond to the Industroyer2 attacks.

Some of the inaccessible airport websited were: Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD). The DDOS attacks were confirmed by an official at Department of Homeland Security; however, an official from CISA refused to comment on the attribution of the attacks.

Following the attacks, the FBI stated on November 4, 2022: ""Coinciding with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the FBI is aware of Pro-Russian hacktivist groups employing DDoS attacks to target critical infrastructure companies with limited success."" The FBI further stated that DDoS attacks have a minor impact on services provided to users because these attacks ""target public-facing infrastructure like websites instead of the actual services.""

In some cases, details also included claims data, recording the location of where a customer received medical services and codes revealing their diagnoses and procedures.
In November the hackers started leaking the stolen data on the dark web containing screencaps from chats or negotiations between Medibank and the ransomware group. 
On the 1st December 2022, Medibank confirmed, that the hackers leaked another dump of stolen data containing health claim information. In February 2023, the company stated that the ""criminal accessed our systems using a stolen Medibank username and password used by a third party IT service provider"" and that ""following the triage of a security alert on 11 October we closed down the criminal’s attack path and can reconfirm no further activity by the criminal since 12 October 2022 has been detected inside our

1615,National Republican Army (NRA) steals data from Russian government contractors and disrupts government websites,"In October 2022, the Kyiv Post disclosed that the Russian hacktivist group National Republican Army (NRA) hacked and stole data from several Russian technology companies based on information received from the group, including sample data allegedly obtained during the operation. Targets included Technoserv, which provides services to protect the Russian government. The group cites the goal of overthrowing Putin as the reason for the attack. Among the documents, according to the NRA, are records that also indicate a relationship between Technoserv and Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB). In an apparant message to Technoserv system administrators, the group claimed to have extracted over 1.2 TB of data,  the equivalent of one million files, ranging from AutoCAD designs, contracts with clients and partners, personal information of employees, including passport details.

Hidden within an app, the surveillance software is distributed via a website designed to imitate a legitimate platform for resources translated from English to Farsi. In a possible attempt to maintain a low profile and avoid premature detection, the app's default permissions are limited to extract contact lists that could enable subsequent spearphishing attacks. Earlier versions of the app contained expansive surveillance functionalities that, if activiated by the attacker, could siphon text messages, device location, information on installed apps, notifications of other apps (including incoming messages) from infected devices and included the capability to capture and exfiltrate photos and videos.

The group set a 24-hour ultimatum for the government to release all political prisoners. When this demand was not met, the group moved to leak information it said it had obtained from the subsidiary's email system.
The 50 gigabytes of published information included, inter alia, administrative and operational plans of the Bushehr nuclear facility, passports and visas of Iranian as well as Russian employees, and contracts and agreements on nuclear development plans, according to a Tweet of the hacking group.

1691,Likely China-linked group RedEcho has been targeting India's energy sector since 2020,"According to Recorded Future, a likely China-linked group named RedEcho has been targeting the Indian energy sector since mid-2020 by using infrastructure tracked by Recorded Future as AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE. The attacks occured in the context of the India-China border clashes that have been taking place since 5 May 2020, possibly indicating efforts to develop leverage through the pre-positioning of malware on strategic assets. RedEcho uses some TTPs that have been used before by other Chinese state-sponsored groups such as APT41 and Tonto Team. However, there is insufficient evidence to attribute the activities to an existing group, so the report attributes the activities to RedEcho. Recorded Future lists twelve targets of the group, which are mainly organisations in the power generation and transmission sector. However, targets in the maritime sector were also affected. Links to a power outage in Mumbai in October 2020 remain unsubstantiated.

It states that it does not ""conclusively attributing the operations to a specific entity, but strong circumstantial evidence suggests a nexus with Spanish authorities"".
The cyber-espionage operation targeted 65 individuals. 52 spyware infections were observed. Among the victims are members of the European Parliament, former Catalan presidents, legislators, jurists, members of the civil society, and also some of their family members. 
The European Parliament launched an inquiry committee to investigate the use of the Pegasus spyware in April, that was already announced in March 2022. This cyber incident is the first time Pegasus spyware was used in Europe. Some of the later reconfirmed victims reported suspected surveillance of their phones as early as 2020.

1704,Pro-Russian hacktivist group Killnet targets Norway entities with DDoS Attack at the end of July 2022,"The Russian hacktivist group, NoName057, targeted Norway government sites in DDoS attacks that rendered Norwegian websites and online services inaccessible. According to NSM (National Security Authority) and media reporting, the group was later identified as the Killnet hacktivist group. IT-company Avast indicated in a report from September 6, that KillNet and NoName057 are actually two cooperating, but separate pro-Russian hacktivist groups. The cyber attacks coincided with ""the decision of Norwegian authorities to block Russian cargo to the Svalbard archipelago"" (an Arctic coal-mining settlement in the Barentsburg region, which Norway controls and allows other countries to access for natural resources); the donation of long-range rocket artillery (MLRS) to Ukraine; and Norway pushing for NATO membership for Finland and Sweden. The Telegram channel ""Legion – Cyber Spetsnaz RF"" published the websites targeted in the attack. The hacktivist group ""Legion"" is affiliated with Killnet. According to NoName057 ""some of the targeted Norwegian entities are Norway's national police, the state's public services portal, the NAV office site (immigration), the Altinn digital government document portal, and the UDI portal (immigration and traveling)."" One organization that is publicly known to have been impacted during the attack is: Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority. According to a Telegram channel, other websites that were claimed in the attack were: ""Norwegian Public Roads Administration, the Stander Consumer Bank, and a financial organization Sbanken Service."" Via social media (Twitter and Telegram), the group supposedly also leaked information when they ""provided links to breached data from the compromised websites...in an attempt to prove their successor hacking campaign.""
Although Norway's Prime Minister, Jonas Gahr Store, stated that he had no knowledge that ""significant damage"" occurred due to the attack. In response to the attack the director of Norway’s NSM, Sofie Nystrøm, released a statement and held a press conference.

The documents were discovered by American cyber-intelligence agents and notified US authorities at the US Embassy in Lisbon.

The stolen documents were acquired through specially programmed bots that probed the network and were trained to discover and detect precisely this type of information. The leak of the documents is of “extreme gravity” and might impact the NATO alliance by creating distrust between members. The EMGFA computers are air-gapped and the data was exfiltrated via standard non-scure lines.

Proofpoint had previously linked TA453 activities to strategic interests of the Intelligence Organization of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC-IO). In its analysis, Proofpoint identifies an evolution in the group's focus on phishing academics, researchers, diplomats, dissidents, journalists, and human rights advocates towards support for kinetic operations. Impersonating or spoofing trusted connections, the group has sought to initiate real world meetings as a setup for kidnapping attempts. In view of this nexus to on-the-ground operations, Proofpoint assesses with medium confidence TA453 may be assisting other state entities, including Iran's Quds Force, the IRGC branch responsible for covert operations.

1813,Hacker group PLAY carried out a ransomware attack on the Belgian city of Antwerp on 6 December 2022,"Hacker group PLAY carried out a ransomware attack on the Belgian city of Antwerp on 6 December 2022, Het Laatste Nieuws reported first. 
The impact and nature of this ransomware attack remain unclear. HLN's initial media report on the morning of Dec. 6 states that the ransomware attack knocked out a variety of community services by hacking servers from IT service provider Digipolis from December 5 to December 6. 
On 6 December vice minister-president of the Flemish government and Flemish Minister for Living Together and Domestic Administration Bart Somers said that he ""now wants to release 1.25 million euros for emergency incidents such as these in Antwerp."" 
On December 11, the hacker group PLAY adds the city of Antwerp to its list of victims on its website. They claim to have stolen 557 gigabytes of data, this includes personal information, passports and more, and announce to publish this data on December 19 if the ransom demand is not paid. 
The following day, ITdaily reports that data from the city of Antwerp has been encrypted, disrupting a variety of municipal services such as libraries, museums, schools. 
On December 19 and before, the mayor of Antwerp Bart de Wever confirmed at a press conference that about 500 gigabytes of data had been stolen. However, he also says that the disruption of the city of Antwerp is not due to the hacker group, but to the city's security measures. The person in charge of the city of Antwerp even reveals that the stolen data is not personal information, as claimed by the hacker group, but login data and documents related to the city's personnel and construction projects.

1859,Swiss security researcher Maia Arson Crimew obtained a copy of the US No Fly List via an unprotected server of US airline CommuteAir in January 2023,"Swiss security researcher Maia Arson Crimew identified an unprotected Jenkins server operated by the US airline CommuteAir during the week of 9 January, according to a blog post on her website. Project files stored on this development server contained login information to Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure used by the airline. On the AWS servers, Crimew discovered records that an airliine representative confirmed were a 2019 copy of the US No Fly List, containing more than 1.5 million entries.
The No Fly List, maintained by the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) within the FBI, includes individuals prohibited from traveling on commercial flights within, into or out of the United States. 
The Swiss hacker made data from the No Fly List available to journalists upon request via the whistleblower platform DDoS Secrets.
Republican Congressman Dan Bishop, a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, demanded an enquiry into why the copy of the No Fly List was not better protected.

1860,Unknown actors gained access to networks of at least two organizations of the US Federal Civilian Executive Branch through the malicious use of legitimate remote monitoring and management software in mid-June and mid-September 2022,"The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned of the malicious use of legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) software in January 2023. The alert notes the deployment of RMM tools by unknown actors against networks of at least two unnamed organizations within the US federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) in mid-June 2022 and mid-September 2022. Both incidents were initiated by phishing emails that faciliated the download of RMM software. With active access to compromised systems, the attackers convinced the recipients to check their bank accounts, providing the attackers with an opportunity to fabricate fake account summaries. These manipulated summaries showed made-up refunds to make victims believe they had been reimbursed too much money.
Victims were requested to ""correct"" this and pay the difference to the attackers. CISA pointed to the scam observed in these two incidents as indications of potential financial motives, while noting that the access developed as part of the campaign could also be used for other malicious purposes.",2022-06-01,2022-09-01,"Attack on (inter alia) political target(s), not politicized",,Incident disclosed by authorities of victim state,Hijacking with Misuse,[['Not available']],['United States'],"[['NATO', 'NORTHAM']]",[['State institutions / political system']],[['Civil service / administration']],['Not available'],['Not available'],['Non-state-group'],['Criminal(s)'],1,2023-01-25 00:00:00,"Technical report (e.g., by IT-companies, Citizen Lab, EFF)",Attribution by receiver government / state entity,Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA),,United States,,,Non-state-group,Criminal(s),['https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa23-025a'],Unknown,Not available,,Not available,,1,2023-01-25 00:00:00,State Actors: Preventive measures,Awareness raising,United States,Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA),No,,Phishing,Data Manipulation,Not available,False,Not available,Not available,"Hijacking, system misuse, e.g., through data theft and / or disruption (incident scores 2 points in intensity)",none,none,2,Moderate - high political importance,2.0,Low,6.0,No system interference/disruption,"Data corruption (deletion/altering) but no leaking of data, no data breach/exfiltration OR major data breach / exfiltration, but no data corruption and/or leaking of data",1-10,2.0,1-10,1.0,Not available,0.0,euro,Not available,Human rights; Sovereignty,; ,Not available,0,,,,,,Not available,,Unfriendly acts/retorsions justified (missing state-attribution & breach ofinternational law OR state-attribution & missing breach of international law),,"['https://therecord.media/cisa-says-federal-agencies-attacked-in-refund-scam-through-remote-management-software/', 'https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/alerts/aa23-025a', 'https://thehackernews.com/2023/01/us-federal-agencies-fall-victim-to.html', 'https://cyberscoop.com/cisa-federal-agency-refund-scam-remote-software/', 'https://twitter.com/campuscodi/status/1618917036448694272', 'https://twitter.com/SentinelOne/status/1619002761974091778']"
1861,FBI infiltrated and dismantled ransomware group Hive beginning in July 2022,"In a press conference on 26 January 2023, US Attorney General Merrick Garland, FBI Director Christopher Wray, and Deputy US Attorney General Lisa Monaco announced that US law enforcement had infiltrated the ransomware group Hive beginning in July 2022 and had now dismantled it. 
The investigation into the group's operations is still ongoing, yet officials at the joint press event announced that the intervention managed to stop Hive from extorting over $130 million from over 300 victims by securing encryption keys.
The US Department of Justice, in cooperation with the German Federal Criminal Police, the Dutch National High Tech Crime Unit and other law enforcement agencies from a total of 13 countries, seized the ransomware outfit's websites and a variety of associated servers.
Against this backdrop, the US State Department reiterated that it is offering a reward of up to 10 million USD for information linking Hive to a foreign government under its Rewards for Justice program regarding foreign malicious cyber activity against US critical infrastructure, which was first announced in July 2021.",2022-07-01,2023-01-01,"Attack conducted by nation state (generic “state-attribution” or direct attribution towards specific state-entities, e.g., intelligence agencies); Attack on non-political target(s), politicized",,Incident disclosed by authorities of victim state,Data theft & Doxing; Hijacking with Misuse,[['Hive (Ransomware Group)']],['Not available'],,[['Social groups']],[['Criminal']],['Not available'],['United States'],['State'],,1,2023-01-26; 2023-01-26; 2023-01-26,"Political statement / report (e.g., on government / state agency websites); Political statement / report (e.g., on government / state agency websites); Political statement / report (e.g., on government / state agency websites)",Attacker confirms; Attacker confirms; Attacker confirms,"Merrick Garland (Attorney General, United States); Christopher Wray (Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, United States); Lisa Monaco (Deputy Attorney General, United States)",,United States; United States; United States,,United States; United States; United States,State; State; State,,"['https://twitter.com/TheJusticeDept/status/1618693732743651363', 'https://twitter.com/FBI/status/1618637314972086272', 'https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-department-justice-disrupts-hive-ransomware-variant']",Cyber-specific,Not available,,Not available,,1,2023-01-26 00:00:00,State Actors: Stabilizing measures,Statement by other ministers/members of parliament,United States,Merrick B.

According to the German Federal Office for Information Security, which monitors information security, the attack caused some minor outages, but was otherwise of limited impact. Both Killnet and German security authorities named the specific targets of this DDoS attack. A complete list of the organizations experiencing disruptions as a result of the attack has not yet been shared publicly.
IT company Cado Security published a summary of DDoS attacks on January 25, 2023, the day they occurred. This report states that Killnet and other hacktivist groups, even as far as Anonymous Sudan, claimed DDoS attacks on behalf of GermanyRIP. Cado Security was also unable to say anything about the extent to which these were successful. 
In Baden-Württemberg's state parliament, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Free Democratic Part (FDP) parliamentary groups put questions to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl after it became known that the state police website was also affected by the DDoS attacks. SPD MP Sascha Binder wanted to know exactly which areas were affected and the extent of the disruption.

1639,Russian spies are suspected of hacking into the personal phone of former british prime minister Liz Truss,"Russian spies are suspected of having hacked into the personal phone of former British Prime Minister Liz Truss while she was serving as Foreign Secretary, according to anonymous sources cited by The Mail on Sunday. 
The incident was discovered during the Conservative Party leadership election that ran from13 July to 5 September 2022, following the resignation of then British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Johnson and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case were immediately informed and decided to keep the incident secret. 
The attackers are believed to have gained access to top-secret exchanges with key international partners as well as private conversations concerning arm shipments to Ukraine and disputes within the Conservative Party.
Earlier, on 1 October, The Mail on Sunday reported that the phone number in use by Ms. Truss at the time of the compromise had been listed by a US-registered website aggregating stolen personal information that is accessible for as little as £6.49.

1891,Iranian state-sponsored hacking group NEPTUNIUM is suspected of stealing personal information from Charlie Hebdo subscribers and defacing its website in January 2023,"The Iranian state-sponsored hacking group Neptunium stole the personal information of subscribers of the French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo and defaced its website in January 2023, Microsoft's Digital Threat Analysis Center (DTAC) assesses with high confidence.
The operation traces back to December 2022, when Charlie Hebdo announced a cartoon contest featuring Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei as the subject. 
On 4 January 2023, a user by the name Holy Souls claimed to have obtained the personal information of 230,000 Charlie Hebdo subscribers. Samples released togehter with the online post show the full names, phone numbers, financial information, as well as email and home addresses of individuals that Le Monde confirmed as actual subscribers of the magazine. The information could expose readers to harm, digitally and in the real world. News about both the defacement and alleged data theft were pushed in a concerted effort across social media platforms that matches with tactics Microsoft had observed for earlier Iranian-directed influence campaigns. 
Reports that the purported cache of customer details was obtained in a breach of the outlet's database are based on statements by Holy Souls that have not been independently or directly confirmed by Charlie Hebdo.
Microsoft identifies Neptunium as Emennet Pasargad, an Iranian cyber firm that was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department in November 2021 over attempts to interfere in the 2020 US presidential elections. The company had previously been designated under the US sanctions regime in February 2019 as Net Peygard Samavat Company before later rebranding as Emennet Pasargad.",,2023-01-01,"Attack conducted by non-state group / non-state actor with political goals (religious, ethnic, etc. groups) / undefined actor with political goals","Attack conducted by a state-affiliated group (includes state-sanctioned, state-supported, state-controlled but officially non-state actors) (“cyber-proxies”) / a group that is generally attributed as state-affiliated ",Incident disclosed by attacker,Data theft; Disruption; Hijacking with Misuse,[['Charlie Hebdo']],['France'],"[['EUROPE', 'NATO', 'EU', 'WESTEU']]",[['Media']],,['NEPTUNIUM / Emennet Pasargad'],"['Iran, Islamic Republic of']","['Non-state actor, state-affiliation suggested']",,1,2023-02-03 00:00:00,"Technical report (e.g., by IT-companies, Citizen Lab, EFF)",IT-security community attributes attacker,Microsoft,,United States,NEPTUNIUM / Emennet Pasargad,"Iran, Islamic Republic of","Non-state actor, state-affiliation suggested",,['https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/02/03/dtac-charlie-hebdo-hack-iran-neptunium/'],System / ideology,Unknown,,Unknown,,0,,,,,,No,,Not available,Data Exfiltration; Defacement,Not available,True,For private / commercial targets: sensitive information (incident scores 2 points in intensity),Short-term disruption (< 24h; incident scores 1 point in intensity),"Hijacking, system misuse, e.g., through data theft and / or disruption (incident scores 2 points in intensity)",none,none,5,Moderate - high political importance,5.0,Low,10.0,Day (< 24h),Major data breach/exfiltration (critical/sensitive information) & data corruption (deletion/altering) and/or leaking of data ,1-10,1.0,,0.0,None,0.0,euro,Indirect (knowingly sanctioning / ordering / ideological / material support by official members of state entities/agencies/units for officially non-state-actors),Sovereignty,,Not available,0,,,,,,Not available,,Countermeasures under international law justified (state-atttribution & breach of international law),,"['https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/02/03/dtac-charlie-hebdo-hack-iran-neptunium/', 'https://cyberscoop.com/iran-charlie-hebdo-hack/', 'https://www.jpost.com/international/article-730541', 'https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/iran-backed-actor-behind-cyberattack-charlie-hebdo-microsoft-says', 'https://twitter.com/iblametom/status/1621513502149206023', 'https://twitter.com/campuscodi/status/1621529797619752962', 'https://securityaffairs.com/141855/apt/charlie-hebdo-data-leak-iran.html', 'https://jyllands-posten.dk/international/ECE14953615/microsoft-iranere-stod-bag-hackerangreb-paa-charlie-hebdo/', 'https://twitter.com/securityaffairs/status/1622219319823241220', 'https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/medias/microsoft-affirme-que-liran-est-a-lorigine-de-la-cyberattaque-contre-charlie-hebdo-1903746', 'https://thehackernews.com/2023/02/microsoft-iranian-nation-state-group.html', 'https://twitter.com/asfakian/status/1622555787158605826', 'https://twitter.com/fr0gger_/status/1622475455805935621', 'https://twitter.com/unix_root/status/1622636487169671169', 'https://twitter.com/780thC/status/1622584638144147457', 'https://www.lemonde.fr/lmdgft/1/NjE1NjkxNi1mZjNlZmMwMGQ1NGUyMWVlMTBmYzRmZjBjZjAzYjU2YzNkY2JkM2NlYjNhZjIwZTg2ZGIwMTJlYThjODA0OWE3?random=1150217085', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20230109230217/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKRnCjbMqEM', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20230109230105/https://breached.vc/Thread-Personal-information-of-230000-customers-of-charliehebdo-fr', 'https://twitter.com/CERTEU/status/1631572192667353089']"

1925,Anonymous Sudan disrupted the website of Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) and leaked customer information on 14 February 2023,"Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) was hacked and its website taken offline by a group referring to itself as Anonymous Sudan. Customers attempting to log in into the airline's app were redirected and shown information from accounts of other passengers. The incident follows a Quran buring by a far-right politician near the Turkish embassy in Stockholm during a protest in January that was funded by a former contributor to the Russian state-funded outlet RT. Anonymous Sudan has since claimed to have conducted a series of denial-of-service attacks against a variety of organizations in Sweden, citing retaliation for the book burning as its motivation. Targets have included the websites of Swedish airports, banks, railways, airlines, media, telecommunication providers, and organizations in the country's health and education sectors. These alleged attempts do not appear to have caused any significant downtime. 
Anonymous Sudan also took responsibility for knocking Sweden's national broadcaster SVT offline on 14 February, around the same time as the attack against SAS.
Marcus Murray, founder of the Swedish cybersecurity firm Trusec, cautioned Anonymous Sudan may be a front for Russian operators, noting that the Quran burning may be an opportunity for Moscow to instigate tension between Sweden and Turkey to hobble Sweden's bid to join NATO. At least one pro-Russian hacker group, UserSec, had promised Anonymous Sudan support on Telegram.

1972,"In February 2022, Azerbaijani political activist Abulfaz Gurbanli becomes the victim of a phishing attack","On 15 February 2022, Azerbaijan Internet Watch reported that the political activist Abulfaz Gurbanli lost access to his Gmail and Facebook account through a phishing email after deleting and resetting his device, and could not access it again until 17 February. A few months earlier, a report was released on the dissemination of the Pegasus spy software and listed numbers of activists, including Gurbanli, whose devices had been infected. This caused Gurbanli to reset his device. On 15 February, he was asked for an interview by an alleged journalist from the BBC Azerbaijan Service, who sent him an email with an infected attachment that, when opened, downloaded malware. Through the backdoor which was installed in the context, the hacker was able to access Gurbanli's accounts and delete the content of at least seven community sites where the activist was an administrator. The attack came shortly after the publication of an article by a pro-government media outlet that accused Gurbanli of organising colour revolutions in Azerbaijan. Based on that, this incident is assigned to the domestic conflict between Azerbaijan and the opposition, even though no attribution has been published.
